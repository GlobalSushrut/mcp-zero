# PARE Network Chain Protocol

## Overview

The Protocol for Agent Retrograde Evolution (PARE) Network Chain Protocol provides sophisticated training capabilities for MCP-ZERO agents through:

1. **Block-Child Training Hierarchy**: Cryptographically verifiable training blocks with parent-child relationships
2. **Non-Euclidean Retrograde Learning**: Advanced learning in hyperbolic, spherical, or mixed geometric spaces
3. **Factorial Voting Consensus**: Heap-based consensus mechanism with mining validation
4. **Memory Tree Integration**: Full persistence with MCP-ZERO's memory trace system

## Architecture Components

### Core Components

1. **PAREChainProtocol** (`chain_protocol.py`)
   - Manages the overall protocol lifecycle
   - Creates and links training blocks
   - Records LLM calls and training data
   - Registers consensus reports
   - Verifies chain integrity

2. **TrainingBlock** (`training_block.py`)
   - Represents discrete training units
   - Maintains parent-child relationships
   - Stores training data and LLM interactions
   - Provides cryptographic verification

3. **NonEuclideanSparseMatrix** (`sparse_matrix.py`)
   - Implements sparse matrix operations in non-Euclidean spaces
   - Supports hyperbolic, spherical, and mixed geometries
   - Provides efficient retrograde update mechanisms
   - Ensures memory efficiency with resource constraints

4. **FactorialVotingConsensus** (`heap_consensus.py`)
   - Implements binary heap-based priority voting
   - Applies factorial weighting for vote influence
   - Provides mining-based validation
   - Generates verifiable consensus reports

5. **RetrogradeLearner** (`retrograde_learning.py`)
   - Manages backward-propagating learning through training blocks
   - Applies learning updates with geometric awareness
   - Maintains recall confidence metrics
   - Ensures memory efficiency

## Using the PARE Protocol

### Initialization

```python
from pare_protocol import PAREChainProtocol

# Initialize protocol
protocol = PAREChainProtocol(
    db_path="memory_trace.db",
    rpc_url="http://localhost:8081"
)
```

### Creating Training Blocks

```python
# Create root block
root_id = protocol.create_training_block(
    agent_id="agent-1",
    training_type="perception",
    metadata={"task": "image_classification"}
)

# Add child blocks
child_id = protocol.add_child_block(
    parent_id=root_id,
    agent_id="agent-2",
    training_type="feature_extraction"
)
```

### Recording Training Data

```python
# Add training data
protocol.add_training_data(
    block_id=child_id,
    content="Feature vector [0.2, 0.8, 0.3, 0.9]",
    data_type="feature_vector"
)

# Record LLM call
protocol.add_llm_call(
    block_id=child_id,
    prompt="Analyze the pattern in this feature vector",
    response="The pattern indicates object type B with 85% confidence"
)
```

### Retrograde Learning

```python
from pare_protocol import RetrogradeLearner

# Initialize learner with non-Euclidean space
learner = RetrogradeLearner(
    dimensions=[10, 10],
    geometry="hyperbolic",
    learning_rate=0.1
)

# Perform retrograde learning
learner.backpropagate(
    indices=(2, 4),
    target_value=0.9,
    propagation_depth=2
)

# Recall learned values
recall = learner.recall((2, 4))
print(f"Value: {recall['value']}, Confidence: {recall['recall_confidence']}")
```

### Consensus Building

```python
from pare_protocol import FactorialVotingConsensus

# Initialize consensus mechanism
consensus = FactorialVotingConsensus(
    consensus_threshold=0.66,
    mining_difficulty=1
)

# Register voters
consensus.register_voter("agent-1", weight=1.0)
consensus.register_voter("agent-2", weight=0.5)

# Submit votes
consensus.submit_vote(
    agent_id="agent-1",
    proposal="object_type_B",
    confidence=0.9
)

# Get consensus result
status = consensus.get_consensus_status()
if status["consensus_reached"]:
    print(f"Consensus: {status['consensus_result']}")
```

## Integration with Memory Tree

The PARE protocol fully integrates with MCP-ZERO's memory trace system, ensuring all training blocks, learning updates, and consensus decisions are cryptographically verifiable and persist beyond individual training sessions.

## Hardware Constraints

The PARE protocol respects MCP-ZERO's strict hardware constraints:
- CPU usage: <27% of a 1-core i3 (2.4GHz)
- Memory usage: Peak 827MB, Average 640MB

All components monitor resource usage and provide warnings when approaching limits.

## Offline Mode

The protocol supports both online (with RPC server) and offline modes:
- Online: Full cryptographic verification via MCP-ZERO RPC server
- Offline: Local-only operation with memory tree persistence
