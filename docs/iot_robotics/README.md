# MCP Zero IoT and Robotics Application Examples

## Current Implementation Status

### Status Overview (June 2025)
- **‚úÖ Completed**: 55 out of 100 planned examples (55%)
- **‚ùå Remaining**: 45 examples still to be implemented (45%)
- **üîÑ Status**: Partial implementation, beta-ready for specific domains

### Core Technical Achievements
- **Offline-First Architecture**: Successfully implemented with modified DBMemoryTree starting in offline mode by default
- **Connection Handling**: Improved to attempt only a single connection with timeout, eliminating repeated errors
- **Local Fallback**: Permanent fallback to offline mode when connectivity fails, with clean error handling
- **Processing Model**: Local processing occurs first, with remote capabilities as enhancement only

### Domains Completed
- ‚úÖ Agricultural & Environmental IoT (46-60)
- ‚úÖ Robotics & Autonomous Systems (61-70)
- ‚úÖ Smart City & Infrastructure (71-85)
- ‚úÖ Special Purpose IoT (86-100)

### Domains Pending Implementation
- ‚ùå Smart Home IoT (1-15)
- ‚ùå Healthcare IoT (16-30)
- ‚ùå Industrial IoT (31-45)

### Strategic Impact
MCP Zero represents a fundamental shift from cloud-dependent IoT to edge-first intelligence, establishing a pattern where connectivity enhances but doesn't dictate functionality. The infrastructure prioritizes resilience, autonomy, and operational continuity in environments with unreliable connectivity.

## About These Examples

This directory contains modular Python IoT and robotics application examples demonstrating MCP Zero's offline-first resilience pattern. Each example is designed to be clear, domain-specific, and follows these core principles:

1. **Offline-First by Default**: Every system initializes in offline mode
2. **Single Connection Attempt**: Only one connection attempt with short timeout
3. **Permanent Offline Fallback**: Systems permanently revert to offline mode if connection fails
4. **Local Processing Priority**: Critical operations continue locally without network dependency
5. **Enhanced Capabilities When Online**: Online mode enables additional features without compromising core functionality

## Implementation Pattern

Each example follows this standard pattern:

```python
class ExampleIoTSystem:
    def __init__(self, local_db_path, remote_service=None, entity_id=None):
        self.mode = "OFFLINE"  # Start offline by default
        # Initialize local components
        
        # Try once to connect to remote service
        if remote_service and entity_id:
            try:
                self.service = RemoteService(remote_service, entity_id)
                if self.service.authenticate(timeout=3):
                    self.mode = "ONLINE"
                    # Get latest parameters
                    self._sync_parameters()
            except Exception:
                # No retry - stay with local processing
                self.service = None
    
    def main_operation_method(self):
        # Get local sensor/data
        
        # Always process locally first
        local_results = self.local_processor.process(data)
        
        # Store data locally
        self.local_db.store(data, local_results)
        
        # If online, report to service
        if self.mode == "ONLINE":
            try:
                self.service.report_data(data, local_results)
                
                enhanced_results = self.service.get_enhanced_processing()
                # Use enhanced results if available
            except Exception:
                # On failure, permanently revert to offline
                self.mode = "OFFLINE"
                self.service = None
        
        return results
```

## Usage

These examples serve as templates for implementing MCP Zero's offline-first resilience pattern across diverse IoT domains. Developers can:

1. Use these examples as starting points for their own MCP Zero applications
2. Adapt the offline-first pattern to their specific requirements
3. Mix and match components to create hybrid systems

All examples use fictional classes that would need to be implemented with actual MCP Zero components, sensor integration code, and domain-specific logic for real-world use.
