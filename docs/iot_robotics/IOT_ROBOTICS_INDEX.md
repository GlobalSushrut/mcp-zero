# IoT and Robotics Applications Using MCP Zero

This documentation describes 100 IoT and robotics applications that leverage MCP Zero's offline-first resilience pattern. Each application strictly follows these principles:

1. Start in offline mode by default
2. Attempt remote connection only once
3. Permanently fall back to offline mode if connection fails
4. Maintain core functionality using local processing when offline

## Categories

The 100 applications are organized into the following categories:

1. Smart Home and Building Automation (Applications 1-15)
2. Industrial IoT and Manufacturing (Applications 16-30)
3. Healthcare and Wearables (Applications 31-45)
4. Agricultural and Environmental (Applications 46-60)
5. Robotics and Autonomous Systems (Applications 61-75)
6. Smart City and Infrastructure (Applications 76-90)
7. Special Purpose IoT (Applications 91-100)

## Core Implementation Pattern

All applications follow this core implementation pattern for offline-first resilience:

```python
class OfflineFirstIoTDevice:
    def __init__(self, local_storage_path, cloud_service_url=None, device_credentials=None):
        self.mode = "OFFLINE"  # Start offline by default
        self.local_storage = LocalStorage(local_storage_path)
        self.local_processor = LocalDataProcessor()
        
        # Try once to connect to cloud service
        if cloud_service_url and device_credentials:
            try:
                self.cloud = CloudService(cloud_service_url, device_credentials)
                if self.cloud.test_connection(timeout=3):
                    self.mode = "ONLINE"
            except Exception:
                # No retry - stay permanently offline
                self.cloud = None
```

Each specific application will implement this pattern with appropriate sensors, actuators, and domain-specific processing logic while maintaining the critical offline-first resilience that MCP Zero provides.
