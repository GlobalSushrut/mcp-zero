# MCP-ZERO v7 - Enterprise Enhancement Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the final polish and enterprise-ready enhancements for the MCP-ZERO v7 infrastructure. We're adding commercial features, deployment mechanisms, and infrastructure improvements to transform MCP-ZERO from a technical demonstration into a production-ready, commercially viable platform.

## Core Architecture Enhancements

### 1. Deployment Mesh

A decentralized deployment network using WebSockets and ZKSync for secure, verifiable agent deployment:

- **WebSocket Protocol Layer**: Enabling real-time bidirectional communication
- **ZKSync Integration**: Zero-knowledge proofs for transaction verification
- **Cloud Connector**: Bridge between local agents and cloud resources
- **Mesh Topology**: Self-healing network of agent nodes

### 2. Commercial Infrastructure

Built-in monetization capabilities for the ecosystem:

- **Agent Marketplace**: Apache-licensed marketplace for buying/selling plugins and agents
- **Metered Billing System**: Usage-based billing for computational resources
- **Revenue Sharing Model**: Distribution mechanism for plugin creators
- **Subscription Management**: Enterprise and individual subscription tiers

### 3. Project Structure Reorganization
