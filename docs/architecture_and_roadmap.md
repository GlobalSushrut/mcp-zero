# MCP-ZERO: Architecture & Roadmap

## System Architecture

MCP-ZERO is designed as a sustainable, resource-efficient agent infrastructure built to last 100+ years. The architecture follows these key principles:

### 1. Core Components

![MCP-ZERO Architecture](../assets/architecture_diagram.png)

#### Layer 1: Hardware Interface
- **Resource Monitor**: Enforces strict hardware constraints (<27% CPU, <827MB RAM)
- **Memory Manager**: Zero-copy operations and efficient garbage collection
- **Compute Scheduler**: Predictive throttling and workload distribution

#### Layer 2: Runtime Environment
- **WASM Sandbox**: Plugin isolation with resource limits
- **Kernel**: Minimal event loop with non-blocking I/O
- **Crypto Engine**: Signature verification and secure communications

#### Layer 3: Agent Infrastructure
- **Agent Lifecycle**: Spawn, execute, snapshot, recover operations
- **Plugin Registry**: Sandboxed capability extensions
- **Intent Processor**: Natural language understanding and action mapping

#### Layer 4: Ethical Governance
- **Policy Enforcement**: Runtime validation of operations
- **Audit Trail**: Cryptographically signed operation history
- **Agreement System**: Human-agent alignment protocols

### 2. Integration Points

MCP-ZERO provides several integration paths:

1. **SDK Integration**: Direct code integration via Python SDK
2. **RPC Layer**: HTTP-based API for language-agnostic integration
3. **CLI Tools**: Command-line utilities for agent management
4. **Plugin System**: Extend functionality without modifying core

### 3. Deployment Models

MCP-ZERO supports flexible deployment to match different use cases:

| Model | Description | Use Cases |
|-------|-------------|-----------|
| Edge | Runs entirely on local devices | IoT, offline scenarios |
| Hybrid | Local agent with cloud support | Enterprise applications |
| Cloud | Fully managed infrastructure | Research, high-compute needs |
| Mesh | Distributed agent network | Resilient, self-healing systems |

## MCP-ZERO Architectural Decisions

### Resource Efficiency Focus

The strict resource limits (<27% CPU, <827MB RAM) are a deliberate architectural choice to ensure:

1. **Sustainability**: Lower energy consumption and carbon footprint
2. **Accessibility**: Runs on modest hardware including legacy devices
3. **Stability**: Predictable performance and failure modes
4. **Longevity**: Future-proofing against hardware changes

### Cryptographic Integrity

All operations in MCP-ZERO maintain cryptographic integrity:

1. **Signatures**: Operations and plugins are signed and verified
2. **Provenance**: Clear chain of evidence for all actions
3. **Non-repudiation**: Cryptographically verifiable audit trail
4. **Key Management**: Secure and recoverable identity system

### Plugin Sandboxing

The WASM-based plugin architecture provides:

1. **Isolation**: Memory and process separation
2. **Resource Limits**: Fine-grained control over consumption
3. **Ethical Boundaries**: Runtime policy enforcement
4. **Portability**: Cross-platform compatibility

## Contribution Guidelines

MCP-ZERO welcomes contributions that align with our mission of sustainable, ethical AI infrastructure:

1. **Code Contributions**: Must pass resource constraint tests
2. **Plugin Development**: Follow the ethical guidelines and resource limits
3. **Documentation**: Clear, accurate, and comprehensive
4. **Testing**: Comprehensive test coverage, especially for resource usage
