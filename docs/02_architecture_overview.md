# MCP-ZERO Architecture Overview

## Core Architecture Philosophy

MCP-ZERO is designed as an immutable foundation for AI agent infrastructure with a 100+ year sustainability horizon. The architecture follows these key principles:

1. **Core Immutability**: The core system is immutable, with all upgrades and extensions happening through plugins and addons
2. **Ethical Governance**: Built-in mechanisms for ethical oversight and governance
3. **Cryptographic Integrity**: Full cryptographic verification of all system components
4. **ZK-Traceable Auditing**: Zero-knowledge verifiable traces of all agent operations
5. **Modular Design**: Highly modular system for maximum flexibility and longevity

## System Components

### Kernel Layer

The MCP-ZERO kernel is implemented in Rust and C++ to provide maximum performance, safety, and longevity. The kernel provides:

- Agent lifecycle management
- Resource allocation and isolation
- Security enforcement and verification
- Core state management
- Plugin system coordination

### SDK Interface Layer

The Python-based SDK Interface provides developers with familiar, high-level abstractions for agent development:

- Agent creation and management APIs
- Plugin integration interfaces
- Communication protocols
- Analytics and monitoring tools
- Template systems for accelerated development

### RPC Layer

The Go-based RPC layer enables efficient communication between system components:

- Lightweight implementation (<30MB footprint)
- Binary protocol for efficiency
- Strong authentication and encryption
- Service discovery and routing
- Rate limiting and throttling

### Trace Engine

The Poseidon+ZKSync trace engine provides cryptographic verification of all system operations:

- Zero-knowledge proofs of execution
- Traceable agent actions
- Verifiable resource usage
- Tamper-proof audit trails
- Historical verification

### Agent Storage

The MongoDB + HeapBT storage system provides efficient and reliable agent state persistence:

- Optimized for agent state snapshots and restoration
- Hierarchical state representation
- Delta-based state changes
- Efficient retrieval and querying
- Backup and redundancy systems

### Plugin ABI

The WASM + Signed ABI system enables secure and portable plugin execution:

- Sandboxed execution environment
- Cryptographically signed plugins
- Capability-based security model
- Cross-platform compatibility
- Deterministic execution

## Hardware Constraints

MCP-ZERO is designed to operate within specific hardware constraints to ensure long-term viability:

- **CPU**: <27% of a single-core i3 (2.4GHz)
- **RAM**: Peak usage of 827MB, average of 640MB
- **Storage**: Modular design allows for flexible storage requirements
- **Network**: Efficient binary protocols minimize bandwidth usage

## Data Flow

1. Applications initiate requests through the SDK Interface
2. Requests are validated against agreements and permissions
3. Resource allocations are checked and enforced
4. Operations are traced and logged cryptographically
5. Kernel executes operations within secure boundaries
6. Results are returned through the SDK Interface
7. All operations are persisted in the agent storage system

## Security Model

MCP-ZERO implements a multi-layered security approach:

1. **Authentication**: API keys, JWT tokens, and cryptographic signatures
2. **Authorization**: Capability-based security model with least privilege
3. **Isolation**: Sandboxed execution environments for agents and plugins
4. **Verification**: Cryptographic verification of all system components
5. **Auditing**: ZK-traceable operations for verifiable history

## Resiliency Features

1. **State Snapshots**: Regular snapshots of agent state
2. **Automatic Recovery**: Self-healing capabilities for agent failures
3. **Distributed Architecture**: No single points of failure
4. **Graceful Degradation**: Core functionality preserved under stress
5. **Version Compatibility**: Strong backward compatibility guarantees
