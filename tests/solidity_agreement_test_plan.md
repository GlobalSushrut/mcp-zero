# Solidity Agreement Middleware Testing Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive testing plan for the Solidity agreement middleware integration with MCP-ZERO RPC server. The middleware provides agreement handling capability without blockchain dependency, with compulsory ethical policies.

## System Under Test
- MCP-ZERO RPC server with embedded Solidity middleware
- REST API endpoints for Solidity agreement functionality
- Ethical policy enforcement mechanisms
- Usage tracking and limit enforcement

## Test Environment
- Hardware: Within MCP-ZERO constraints (<27% CPU, <827MB RAM)
- Server: Go-based RPC server running on localhost:8082
- Test Client: Python-based test scripts

## Test Categories

### 1. Basic Functionality Tests
- Health check endpoint verification
- Server startup with and without Solidity middleware enabled
- API discovery and endpoint availability

### 2. Agreement Creation Tests
- Create valid agreement with required fields
- Attempt to create agreement with missing required fields
- Attempt to create agreement without ethical policies (must fail)
- Verify agreement creation with multiple ethical policies

### 3. Agreement Verification Tests
- Verify existing agreement with valid ID
- Attempt to verify non-existent agreement
- Verify expired agreement status
- Check agreement active/inactive status

### 4. Ethical Compliance Tests
- Test compliance check with acceptable content
- Test compliance check with harmful content (should fail)
- Test compliance check with excessive usage quantities (should fail)
- Test multiple policy validation in a single request

### 5. Usage Recording Tests
- Record valid usage within limits
- Attempt to record usage exceeding limits (should fail)
- Record usage for multiple metrics
- Verify usage accumulation across multiple recordings

### 6. Performance and Resource Tests
- Measure response times for agreement operations
- Monitor memory usage during peak operations
- Verify compliance with MCP-ZERO hardware constraints

## Test Execution Strategy
1. Start with basic API health checks
2. Progress through agreement lifecycle tests
3. Test edge cases and error conditions
4. Verify resource usage compliance

## Success Criteria
- All API endpoints return correct status codes and responses
- Ethical policies are correctly enforced
- Agreement lifecycle is properly managed
- Resource usage stays within MCP-ZERO constraints
- All error conditions are properly handled

## Test Cases Sequence
1. Health check API
2. Create agreement with ethical policies
3. Verify created agreement
4. Test ethical compliance checks
5. Record and verify usage tracking
6. Test agreement expiration handling
7. Test error cases (missing policies, invalid IDs)
